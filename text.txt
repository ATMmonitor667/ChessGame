-> UseState to handle the track of which player goes when
-> function to flip the Board, we can also you useStatesame as before
-> Peice Movements can be handled with the dir applied on the queen, rook, etc
-> Still have not decided if the peices will be Object oriented or functional
-> Thinking of combining the two approaches, it will hold Objects information like the color, peice positon, and moveSet
-> the moveset will contain all the possible moves a peice can make
-> useState to manage the board. With every Drag and Drop it will trigger the function which will change the contents
of the board and which will trigger a state change. Again we should use useState to manage the board changes
the use State will take the initail board state and the new board state and update the board state
-> The board will be a 2D array of objects, each object will contain the peice information
